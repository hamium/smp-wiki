##### :material-account-question: About
A fierce PVPer, Minocp has been a member in the server since the beginning. Every season, he follows a tradition of building massive sheep farms, and stacking player heads. Minocp was a member of SLON in Season 1, the original Greenies in Season 2, a member of DRON (Democratic Republic of Noxus) in Season 3, and is the current second-in-command of the [***Internet Explorers***](../factions/ie.md) <br>

##### Season 2

Time has eroded his memories, and he concludes that his time with the original Greenies (not the one revived by Reguleo) was uneventful. It was during this season where he built a sheep farm that dropped the server TPS to 3, and the tradition of the *Head Stack* was born. 

##### Season 3

Season 3 brings forth a repeat of his sheep farm - a collaborated effort - containing 5000 to 1000 entities inside it. The *Head Stack* reached the increased 1.18 height limit. He was the first person on the server to kill the Ender Dragon.

##### Season 4

This season, Minocp joined the [***Internet Explorers***](../factions/ie.md) faction. <br>
Some of his achievements this season include:<br>
1. He was the first person on the server to obtain the original Dragon Egg in [***The End***]() event<br>
2. He was the first person to complete his personal World Map, or explore every chunk on the server.<br>
The IE Base is the place he calls home on the server, alongside several other IE members.
