##### :octicons-goal-16: Goal
The Internet Explorers was created by [***ham***](../staff/ham.md) and [***claniverse***](../staff/realclay.md) with the original goal of exploring the entirety of the server. However, the two leaders separated from their own faction, and went on to create the [***Opera Institute of China***](oc.md). [***Hades***](../players/hades.md) was unanimously elected the leader, and the faction's ultimate goal was ammended to "becoming the most powerful and influential faction on the server". <br>

##### :octicons-trophy-16: Achievements
The IE is one of the most successful factions on the server. It has achieved many notable feats, such as:<br>
1. It pioneered industrial farms to add to its prosperity. The server's first Raid Farm, Guardian Farm, Blaze Farm, Slime Farm, and Gold Farm are all properties of the IE.<br>
2. Personal achievements of its members add to its own timeline of event. The IE holds the possession of the original Dragon Egg, and the most number of elytras. <br>
3. The IE was the first faction to obtain 2 beacons, and the second faction to obtain a beacon.<br>
4. Keeping true to its explorer roots, the IE became the first faction to explore the entire world and load every chunk within world border. Currently, the three members who have achieved the complete World Map on Xaero's World Map are [***Minocp***](../players/minocp.md), [***iSark***](../players/isark.md), and [***Hades***](../players/hades.md), in order.<br>

##### :fontawesome-solid-tent: The Base
The main base of IE is a floating village in the middle of the ocean - the "*Raft Simulator*". It is where all the farms and the trading hall are located. The village is located between the "*Mushroom Cliffs*" and the "*Floating Isles*". The nearest land is around 250 blocks from the edge of the base. <br>

##### Alliances
The Internet Explorers, or the IE created new alliances with two of the strongest factions on the server - [***Aerial Empire***](ae.md) and [***Sovereign Lands of Noxus***](slon.md). This proved to catalyze its growth as the resources were used profitably by all three factions. Many structures were built in collaboration, like the first Gold Farm, the first Slime Farm, etc. While the Aerial Empire was an official ally with the IE, the creator of SLON (Sovereing Lands of Noxus), [***unium***](../staff/unium.md) describes their alliance as "me and hades chill fr".<br>

##### The End Event
The IE was at the forefront during the End Event. Two strongholds were already marked at explored by IE alone, and a third by the AE. ManBoyThing of IE killed the Ender Dragon, while [***Minocp***](../players/minocp.md) obtained the original Dragon Egg. [***Hades***](../players/hades.md) and Minocp were also the first to get elytras. <br>

##### Silence Trim Incident
A devious plot by [***ItzSKP***](../players/itzskp.md) was to explore all the Ancient Cities in the 5000 by 5000 block area within world border in search of the fabled Silence Trim, and deprive all other members from it. It has a 1.2% chance of spawning in Ancient City chest. Amidst countless Wardens, the AE and the IE were the first to obtain it. While some Ancient Cities remain unexplored, the two factions were successful at making the trim extremely rare.<br>

##### The Industrial Revolution
Two new members left the ruins of the [***Banana Syndicate***](bs.md) and joined the IE - buk_08 and [***iSark***](../players/isark.md). They built numerous farms around the IE Base. buk_08 created the server's first Guardian Farm and Blaze Farm. iSark fixed the broken Villager Breeders, Iron Farm, and created String Duper, Cobblestone farm, and the server's first Slime Farm. To achieve world domination, the IE must achieve self-sufficiency of resources.<br>

##### The Island Project and Land Upgrade
Living on water on a floating village is difficult. Large vats of water must be cleared to build up infrastructure. [***Giangvu***](../players/giangvu.md) took up the project of transforming the floating village into a replica of the Gibraltar Islands. This would give an impetus to creative builds, and not just mechanical farms. Near the Floating Isles, he created a replica of the Bikini Atoll.<br>
