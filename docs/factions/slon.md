##### :octicons-goal-16: Goal
The Sky Crew was a peaceful faction, and were very distant from server politics. Their goal was to uphold this peace, and create a self-sustaining domain in a Cherry Blossom Forest. Despite being one of the lesser known factions, the Sky Crew remains one of the few factions not disbanded due to player inactivity. <br>

##### :octicons-trophy-16: Achievements
Nothing much is known about the Sky Crew's feats. They members seldom played on the server, and mostly as a cohesive faction :<br>
1. The Sky Crew created the fastest raid farm, with the help from JackSmith, and a fully decorated Iron Farm (design copied from the [***AE Iron Farm***](ae.md)<br>
2. They were friendly to all factions, and therefore difficult to declare war on.<br>
More will be added to this list as their achievements surface...

##### :fontawesome-solid-tent: The Base
The main base of the SC is atop a cliff, overlooking a river, amidst Cherry Blossom Trees. Since pink is the favourite colour of [***aji***](../staff/aji.md), all of their builds are pink-themed. A secondary base is located near a Swamp, consisting of their Raid Farm, Iron Farm, and Village Breeder.<br>

##### Alliances
The SC had mutual alliances with most factions. While they were self-sustaining in resources, they kept good relations with the powerful factions.<br>

##### The Decline
Most of the members on the faction quit due to personal reasons. This void culminated into the mass server inactivity, preceeding the start of Season 5.
